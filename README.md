# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
The Gaming Room, the client, requested a game called Draw it or Lose it in which teams compete to predict what will be drawn. 
As clues, the application will display images from a sizable library of stock drawings rather than a player sketching pictures 
on an easel to assist team members in guessing the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing). There are four rounds of play in a game,
and each round lasts one minute. At the 30-second point, all drawings have been rendered in their entirety. The remaining teams 
have a chance to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit if the team does not guess the puzzle before 
the time runs out. Only the Android app is available for this game at this time.

I believe I did a great job of organizing the information and providing a helpful perspective on the issues at hand while creating this documentation.

I found this documentation to be helpful in many ways while writing code using it. First, by having all the knowledge required
to decide which operating system should be used and its limitations. Having a UML diagram of the code also aids in resolving coding
issues. Finally, knowing what to use while developing across all the different OS was made easier by having the development tools for each OS.

The development tools in this document are one thing I would change. I want to go into more detail about what can be used and how 
they can enhance the application as a whole.

In order to develop software that meets user needs, the user centered design process involves researching the needs, preferences,
and behaviors of users. It entails gathering user information, developing user personas and scenarios, designing prototypes, and 
running usability tests. The software is made effective, efficient, and satisfying for users thanks to this process, which enhances 
user engagement and results in better user experiences.
